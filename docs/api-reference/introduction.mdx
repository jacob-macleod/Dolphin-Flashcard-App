This is the reference documentation for the Dolphin Flashcard API. Our API allows you to set up user accounts, create and manage flashcards, set learning goals, and track performance. Data is available in `JSON` format only. <br></br>

To make navigation easier, the endpoints are grouped into four sections: `Account`, `Card management`, `Goals`, and `Statistics`.

**Note**: All parameters are case-sensitive. Request body parameters are required, but query string parameters are optional.
