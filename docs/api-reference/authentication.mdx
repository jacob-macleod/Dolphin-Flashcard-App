title: 'Authentication'
---

Most requests require a JWT Token to run. While we aim to add an API enpoint to generate this in the future,
this currently requires the user to log in with the deployed website.

Note that while `/api/create-account` and `/api/sign-in` do not require a JWT Token, they do require the `idToken`
parameter, which is only provided by Firebase.

To get a JWT Token, follow these steps:
* Log in or create an account
* Open the developer console. On Chrome, this can be done with `Ctrl-Shift-j`
* Navigate to the "Cookies" panel
* Find the `jwtToken` cookie, click on it, and save its value
    * This is used for authentication - you shouldn't share it with anyone!

If you want to develop a seperate frontend or some sort of automation and you need to programatically create a JWT Token for
authentication, please create an Issue on Github, and either work on it yourself, asking for any information as needed, or
assign it to `@jacob-macleod` and ask him to work on it

An API to get the JWT Token could easily be written by following the above steps using a framework such as Selenium (Python).
