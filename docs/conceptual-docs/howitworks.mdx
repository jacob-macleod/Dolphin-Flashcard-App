title: 'How it Works'

Dolphin operates much like physical flashcards - except that you'll be dealing with digital cards this time. By signing up for an account, you can create flashcards, set goals, and track your progress over time.

Each flashcard has two sides: a front and a back. Typically, you add a question or definition on the front and an answer or target term on the back. Within your account, flashcards can be grouped into sets and folders. An indicator displays the number of cards to learn or revise within each folder or set.

    Our [Quick Start guide](/conceptual-docs/quickstart) provides instructions to help you get started faster.

For each flashcard set, you can set up a goal. Goals can be of two types: card and experience points (XP). A card goal is the number of flashcards you aim to learn in a predefined period, while an XP goal is the number of experience points you plan to accumulate within a given time. Goals you have not achieved are marked as 'in progress', goals you have completed are marked as 'completed', and goals you could not meet are marked as 'failed'.

There is a leaderboard with multiple levels. Finishing among the top five users in each level pushes you to the next level. You will be rewarded with gold and a profile badge when you win quests, such as learning a specific number of cards, adding a certain number of cards, maintaining a streak for a specified number of days, etc.

    Winning the same quest again increments the badge number associated with your profile badge.

Your accountâ€™s heatmap and streak data help track your performance. Heatmap indicates active study days and the number of cards learned each day, while streak represents the total number of consecutive learning days.

Dolphin uses a spaced repetition algorithm to enhance memorability and help you achieve more in your learning journey. The next section will guide you through using the app to create and manage flashcards.
