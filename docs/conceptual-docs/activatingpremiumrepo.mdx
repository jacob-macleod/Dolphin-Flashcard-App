title: 'Premium Modules'
---

Welcome! Here, you'll learn how to set up and start using the premium repository. Soon, there will be a video linked here to help you
quickly get up to speed.

## What is the premium repo?

### Overview

Dolphin Flashcards is open source, which means its code is publically accessible and usuable by anyone on Github.
However, there are also some *optional modules*, which hold the code for premium features. While Dolphin Flashcards
can be fully used just by using the open source code, the premium features can also be imported to access extra features

There is one repository which stores all the premium features. This repository is closed source, so everyone needs to be
added by [jacob-macleod](https://github.com/jacob-macleod). This repository also uses a different license.

### How does it work?

The premium repository is an optional module:

* It is cloned as a submodule in `frontend/src`
* A symbolic link is created from `frontend/src/<the submodule repository>` to `backend`
    * This means the files are copy and pasted from one location to the other.
    Any change in one location also changes the files in the other location
    * The folder in `backend` is named `dolphin_flashcards_premium_features`

## Installation Guide

Before following these steps, you need to be granted access to the repository by [jacob-macleod](https://github.com/jacob-macleod).

### Linux and MacOS

Clone Dolphin Flashcards and run `bash install_premium_repo.sh`. This will:
* Clone the repository to `frontend/src`
* Symbolically link the repository to `backend/`, under the folder name `dolphin_flashcards_premium_features`

### Windows

Follow the above steps yourself. If your changes are correct, you should be able to see a folder called `Dolphin-Flashcards-Premium-Features`
in `frontend/src` and `dolphin_flashcards_premium_features` in `backend/`. If you have any questions, contact
[jacob-macleod](https://github.com/jacob-macleod).
