Dolphin Flashcards is a gamified flashcard application designed to aid memorization and enhance learning. This is made possible by implementing a spaced repetition algorithm in an easy-to-use and visually pleasing user interface. The website, which is still in development, can be found [here](http://www.dolphinflashcards.com).
