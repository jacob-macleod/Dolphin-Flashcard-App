title: Why Dolphin Flashcards?

---

A combination of the following features sets Dolphin Flashcards apart:

* An engaging and visually appealing user interface (UI)
* A spaced repetition algorithm
* Gamification with plenty of "juice"

None of the existing flashcard apps incorporate all these features. These Unique Selling Points (USPs) and Points of Differentiation provide a unique opportunity for Dolphin Flashcards. For more information on what to expect from the app, see the [planned features](https://github.com/jacob-macleod/Dolphin-Flashcard-App/tree/main#USPsandPointsofDifferentiation)
