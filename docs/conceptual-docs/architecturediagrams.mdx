We have several architecture diagrams, which aim to help you understand the site


## Database Design

This image shows the database design for Dolphin Flashcards, each block showing a different collection in the NoSQL Firebase database. Duplicated data is shown in red, which may offer some oppurtunity for simplification, although maybe not. An underline shows a foreign key, and bold shows a primary key.
