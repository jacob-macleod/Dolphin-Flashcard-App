### Added

- The study button next to the folder now allows you to study all cards in the folder

When implementing the edit-flashcard page fully, the page should use the API to read flashcard details when `newSet` is not true

### Removed

- Deprecated /api/calculate-card-stats - this will now be done by the client to improve speed
- Deprecated /api/get-weekly-xp and /api/get-total-xp - the frontend calculates them at the same time, so it makes sense to use /api/get-user-stats to pull this data instead
